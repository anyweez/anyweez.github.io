        <h3>Stable communication and teams</h3>
        <p class="date">October 24, 2020</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content"><p>One important realization I've had over the last twelve months has been how much more efficient a team can be if they consistently respond to similar questions the same way. Stable responses provide autonomy for other team members, who don't need to check in to make a good prediction on what you think about something (whether X is a good idea, whether X or Y is higher priority, etc).</p>
<p>The team's efficiency and speed will be limited by how easy it is to make [sticky decisions]. If a large percentage of decisions require approval/review with managers or a broader team, etc then:</p>
<ul>
<li>the team's velocity will slow down; this has a compounding effect because the manager also has a manager, who has a manager, etc</li>
<li>bottlenecks will form at the people who actually make decisions, such that getting decisions from those in the bottleneck takes longer, thus slowing down the whole system</li>
<li>it may feel risky for the team to trust un-reviewed decisions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measuring-consistency">Measuring consistency</h2>
<p>Write down a list of questions that it'd typically be &ldquo;your job&rdquo; to answer; these should include things that your team members may bring to you. Write out answers and have members of your team (a) write out how they think you'd answer and (b) state whether they're confident or would want to confirm with you. I like questions that are prioritization related &ndash; should I spent my time on A or B, is X or Y a higher priority on the roadmap, I have conflicts between meeting C and D &ndash; which should I attend?, etc.</p>
<p>Compare the results, which should fall into four categories for each team member:</p>
<pre><code>Group 1: confident matches (same answer, team member was confident)
Group 2: unconfident matches (same answer, team member was not confident)
Group 3: confident misses (different answers, team member was confident)
Group 4: unconfident misses (different answers, team member was not confident)
</code></pre><p>Group 1 are &lsquo;hits&rsquo;, and more is better. The other groups all indicate areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Group 2, low Group 4 suggests that the team member actually has a pretty good sense of your point of view, but doesn't feel comfortable running with it themselves. Empower that person.</li>
<li>High Group 2, high Group 4 suggests that your responses feel inconsistent from the team member's perspective.</li>
<li>High Group 3 suggests a fundamental misunderstanding or ambiguity around first principles. Decisions will often not be sticky, which will erode trust with other team members over time.</li>
</ul>
