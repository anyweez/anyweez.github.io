Programmatically generating these worlds is one of my go-to projects when I feel like coding, and I've been merging a few of these efforts into a single codebase that I can add onto every now and then to gradually get better results.</p>

                <p class="desc">I've been doing a lot of financial modeling in spreadsheets recently and have hit some walls with scenario / &ldquo;what if&rdquo; planning. As a result I created a basic programming language that can be used for expressing financial models, with a specific focus on scenario planning. I've successfully transitioned my personal spreadsheets over and have a few other use cases that I'm excited to explore, and the potential audience for a tool like this is something I'm excited to learn more about.</p>
