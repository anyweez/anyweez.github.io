      <description>I grew up interested in fantasy worlds and have been hooked on the idea of building them since I was in middle school. Programmatically generating these worlds is one of my go-to projects when I feel like coding, and I&#39;ve been merging a few of these efforts into a single codebase that I can add onto every now and then to gradually get better results. It&#39;s way too fun, even if the world quality still isn&#39;t very good yet.</description>
