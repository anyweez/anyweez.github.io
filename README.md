I've gone to a fully static personal site, which is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted as static assets (HTML/CSS). Posts are written in Markdown and compiled into HTML by Hugo prior to positng online.

This repo contains a Hugo project, including raw posts, that I compile into my actual web assets. Hugo is not included and needs to be downloaded and installed separately.
